In my project, I want to use the dataset called NYC Dog Licensing Dataset from NYC Open Data. 
In this dataset, it records the information about the dogsâ€™ license such as breed name, birthday, 
gender and the dates of license issued and expired. I want to create a python program to analyze these data, 
for example, it can search the dataset to find the expired date, insert a new record in dataset, 
I want to find the trend of the birth number of dogs, and find which district has the most number of dogs .
By using all these findings, I can sale it to NYC dog License to help them establish an online system, 
where people can search or register the information of their dogs. 
Meanwhile it also can give the advice for the companies about where they can promote pet toy, dog food, dog medicine and dog service.
